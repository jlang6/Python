Up and Down is a 4-7 player trick-taking game played with a standard 52-card deck, ace high. 
A trick is simply when everyone takes turns playing a card from their hand, and the highest card wins. 

At the beginning of each round:
- Cards are dealt evenly (7 for first round, then 6, 5... until 1. Then 2, 3, ... up to 10 in the last round)
- After dealing, the top card is flipped over to reveal the trump suit
- Trump automatically beats all suits except other trump cards, where high card still wins
- Starting with the person to the left of the dealer, players take turn betting

Rules for betting:
- If you are not the dealer: you can bet any number you wish 
- The dealer's bet cannot cause the sum of bets to equal that round's hand size ("screw the dealer" rule)
- For example: On round 1 (hand size of 7), if the sum of bets is 5, the dealer cannot bet 2. 
- This ensures that at least one person will fail to match his/her bet each round

Rules for playing cards: 
- Person to the left of the dealer starts first
- You must follow the led suit (same as first card played) if you are able to
- If you don't have a card of the led suit, you are free to play any card
- Cards are always played clockwise
- The winner of the previous trick starts the next one
- Play continues until everyone is out of cards

At the end of each round:
- If you matched your bet, you get 5 points plus 5 for every bet you made 
- For example: betting 0 gives 5 points, betting 1 gives 10 pointsâ€¦
- But if you are over or under, you lose 5 points times the difference between your bet and the
  actual amount you won
