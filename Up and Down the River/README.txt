"Up and Down the River - A Python Game"

Instructions:
To play the game, run game.py. All actions are performed through the console. Sounds are only available on Windows.
You will be prompted to enter your name. Enter anything but an empty space.
Next, enter Y/N for whether or not you want to read the rules. To browse the rules without opening the game,
open up "rules.txt", located in the game's files. During the game, you bet the number of tricks you believe 
you'll win along with which card you want to play by typing the appropriate number. 
Once the game is over, the results are stored in "scores.txt"


Note: Some bugs have been detected that were unable to be solved prior to the project deadline. If you experience
one and the game crashes, you will have to restart the game, unfortunately. Most of the time you should be able
to play error-free.
